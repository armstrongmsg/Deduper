The purpose of deduper to exist is to help the study of data deduplication in 
a oportunistic distributed file system. Through deduper the user can simulate 
a system of this kind and discover properties of the deduplication in the system.

deduper enables to simulate:
- the file allocation: in which machines the files are stored in the system.
- the file similarity: the similarity between the files in the system. Files are 
considered similar if their contents are equals.
- the file popularity: the amount of accesses to the files.

deduper provides a command-line interface to the user to pass arguments.

Initially the system was designed to investigate the impact of the data deduplication 
in the file access time.
